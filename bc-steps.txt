To develop the smart contracts for your DAO, you can follow these steps

Set up a Solidity development environment Install Solidity compiler and development tools. You can use tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat to develop and deploy your smart contracts. Follow the installation instructions for your chosen development environment. ***

Create a new Solidity file Create a new .sol file, such as DAO.sol, to define your smart contracts. This file will contain the contracts that govern the DAO's operations. (ADD THE MINT OPERATION AND CREATE THE TOKEN

Define the DAO contract In your DAO.sol file, define the main DAO contract that will handle proposals and voting. Here's an example contract to get you started:

///////////


In this example, the DAO contract contains a Proposal struct to store proposal details and tracks votes for options A and B. The createProposal function allows the admin to create a new proposal, and the vote function allows token holders to submit their votes.

Compile and deploy the smart contract: Use your Solidity development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat) to compile and deploy the DAO contract to a testnet or local blockchain. Follow the instructions provided by your development environment to compile and deploy the contract.

Create a command-line script: Develop a command-line script that interacts with the deployed smart contract. This script should allow the admin to create new proposals on-chain with the necessary fields. You can use a library like ethers.js or web3.js to interact with the smart contract.
